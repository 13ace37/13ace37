## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Riccardo 'ace' H. I am a self-taught programmer and designer from Germany currently living in Switzerland.

I mostly focus on backend, functional or object-oriented programming. But from time to time I also do some frontend. My first priority in coding is that I never have to repeat myself, nor do things multiple times. I rather spend a little more time minimizing or automating those tasks than doing them by hand every time.

I currently work as a software and application engineer with a focus on optimizing department workflows. My goal is to automate and eliminate unnecessary steps while maintaining consistent standards to reduce integration time.

I started programming/scripting at the age of 12 and have been expanding my skills ever since.
In 2018, I jumped into Linux server administration and also delved deeper into mastering automation. Since then I always try to get the best out of my code by optimizing it. I also tend to keep everything, including my internal code, modular and prepared for the future.
